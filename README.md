# wrangle_and_analyze_data

This poject was completed as part of Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree course requirements. In this project, I must implement what I learned in part data wrangling from the Udacity Data Analysis program. The project is about to gather data from WeRateDogs which is a Twitter account that rates dogs, including dogâ€™s name, stage, and a number of retweets, etc. in this project I had to go through gather steps, assessing, cleaning, and analysis.
